## Recent Refactoring (v2.4.0)

The codebase underwent a major refactoring in v2.4.0 to improve maintainability and performance:

### CSS Modularization

The monolithic `styles.css` has been split into specialized files:

- **css/base.css**: Variables, reset, base elements
- **css/layout.css**: Structural layout and positioning
- **css/components.css**: Reusable UI components
- **css/modules.css**: App-specific modules
- **css/dark-mode.css**: Dark mode styles
- **css/animations.css**: Animation keyframes
- **css/responsive.css**: Media queries

### Code Structure Improvements

- Fixed circular dependencies in JS modules
- Removed redundant code
- Implemented proper ES module patterns
- Added dynamic imports for better separation of concerns

### File Structure

```
/css               # CSS modules
